Overview of project

The provided Python program functions as a basic student grade tracker. Here's an overview of its functionalities:

Functionality:

User Input: The program prompts the user to enter two numbers and choose an operation (+, -, *, /).
Error Handling: It includes a try-except block to handle potential ValueError if the user enters something other than a number for the grades or enters an invalid operator.
Calculation: The program defines a function calculate that takes the two numbers and the operator as input. Based on the operator, it performs the corresponding arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) and returns the result. Division by zero is handled with an error message.
Output: If the calculation is successful, the program displays the result in a formatted string showing the numbers, operator, and calculated value.
Loop: The program enters a loop that continues until the user chooses to exit. Inside the loop, it prompts the user for calculations, validates input, performs calculations, and displays results.
Exit Option: The program asks the user if they want to perform another calculation. If the user enters anything other than 'y' (case-insensitive), the loop breaks, and the program exits.
Overall, this program provides a user-friendly way to perform basic arithmetic operations and track student grades. It ensures valid input through error handling and offers a convenient way to perform multiple calculations consecutively.

Enhancements:

The program can be extended to calculate other statistics like percentages or class averages.
More comprehensive error handling can be implemented to catch other potential input errors (e.g., negative grades).
